Why?
====
 
  Gmail's web-interface is impressive. It's feature set includes a fully-functioning [Hangouts](http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/) client, a seemingly "aware" inbox which will keep you informed of incoming email without requiring you to refresh the page. The convenience doesn't end there. You can even receiving notifications when your browser tab isn't in your field of view thanks to Gmail's support for [desktop notifications](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/1075549?hl=en). The list goes [on](https://www.gmail.com/intl/en_us/mail/help/features.html). 
  
 These convenience features are made possible by customized javascript software that's running behind the scenes and powering your Gmail experience. In essence this is all **good stuff**. It makes e-mail a whole new, almost enjoyable experience and nothing is more important than creating a software experience that users love. But it's not for everyone.
 
Aside from the swaths of users that might just want to disable all these features at-once (for whatever reason, bandwidth constraints or otherwise), it's important to keep in mind that a significant number of email users value the privacy of their email. By opting in to all the features alluded to above, one increases the available attack surface for any attacker hoping to gain unauthorized access to your personally identifable information.
