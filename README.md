Why?
====
 
  Gmail's web-interface is impressive. It's feature set includes a fully-functioning [hangounts](http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/) client, a seemingly "aware" inbox which will inform you when you receive a new e-mail message, long gone are the days of refreshing your inbox to check for new mail! It doesnt' stop there. Want to receive notifications even when your browser is closed, look no further than Gmail's [desktop notifications](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/1075549?hl=en). The list goes [on](https://www.gmail.com/intl/en_us/mail/help/features.html). 
  
  In essence this is all **good stuff**. It makes e-mail a whole new, almost enjoyable experience. However, aside from the swaths of users that might just want to disable all these features at-once, it's important to keep in mind that a significant number of email users value the privacy of their email. By opting in to all the features alluded to above, one increases the available attack surface for anybody hoping to eavesdrop.
